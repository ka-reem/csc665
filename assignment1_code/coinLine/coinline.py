The actions function should return a list of all the possible actions that can be taken given a state.

Each action should be represented as a tuple (i, j) where i corresponds to the side of the line ('L', 'R')

Possible moves depend on the numner of coins left.

Returns the line of coins that results from taking action (i, j), without modifying the

The returned state should be the line of coins and scores that would result from taking the 
original input state, and letting the player whose turn it is pick the coin(s) indicated by the 
input action.

Importantly, the original state should be left unmodified. This means that simply updating the 
input state itself is not a correct implementation of this function. Youâ€™ll likely want to make a 
deep copy of the state first before making any changes.
