    Returns the set of all possible actions available on the current state of the jugs.

    The actions function should return a list of all the possible actions that can be taken given a state.

    Each action should be represented as a tuple (action_kind, i, j) 
    action_kind is one of: "fill", "empty" and "pour"
    i corresponds to the jug affected by the action
    j is a valid number only if the action is "pour" (i.e. pour from jug i into jug j). Otherwise it should be set to None

    """
    Returns the state of the jugs after taking action (kind, i, j), without modifying the original state.

    If `action` is not a valid action for the current state, you  should raise an exception.

    The returned state should be: tuple([j1, j2, j3]) 
    where j1, j2 and j3 represent the amount of water in each jug, respectively. 

    Importantly, the original state should be left unmodified. This 
    means that simply updating the input state itself is not a correct 
    implementation of this function. Youâ€™ll likely want to make a 
    copy of the state first before making any changes.
